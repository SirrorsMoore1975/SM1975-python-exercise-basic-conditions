# isOddWithoutIf
## As a student
Your task, as a student, is to pass the test by create a function that can return `True` if a given number is odd and `False` if it is not odd. But you cannot use any if condition within your script.

```py
def isOddWithoutIf(x):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
```

- [ ] Write a script that can return True if x input is odd, return False when x is not odd.
- [ ] The script did not use an if statement. 

## Writing test
As a developer using `TDD` under `pytest`, your task is to:-
- [ ] use `AST` (Abstract Syntax Tree) to write a test that can detect the script whether it has used any if statement
- [ ] fetch test data into the `isOddWithoufIf` to see if the given script can pass your test.
